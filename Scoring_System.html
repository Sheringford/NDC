			<h1>Scoring System</h1><p>
				<h2>Points per supply centre</h2><p>
				The C-diplo Namur scoring system will be used. The best two games of a player count fully towards the tournament score while the third best game only counts half. Best Country awards will be determined using the individual game score under the system. See scoring for more information.<p>
				The first six supply centres are scored as shown below. All further supply centres are worth one point each<p>
				1 Sc = 5pts<p>
				2 Sc = 9pts<p>
				3 Sc = 12 pts<p>
				4 Sc = 14 pts<p>
				5 Sc = 16 pts<p>
				6 Sc = 18 pts<p>
				<h2>Rank based bonus</h2><p>
				Players in first, second and third position receive a bonus to their score. If any number of players tie for any of these positions, the bonus(ses) are evenly divided between the players.<p>
				first = 38pts<p>
				second = 14pts<p>
				third = 7 pts<p>
				<h2>Participation and solo points</h2><p>
				A player who soloes scores 85 points and all players soloed on score 0 points. Unless a solo happens, all players score one point for participation.<p>
				<h2>What if Iâ€™m lazy/bad at arithmetic </h2><p>
				Scoring sheets with all possible scores will be distributed at the tournament.
